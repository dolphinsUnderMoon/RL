# RL

This is a simple implementation about Q-learning and Sarsa (Tabular Q learning) about reiforcement learning in Python. I used Numpy and Pandas.

`one_dim_explore.py` is the source code, the agent `o` try to go to the destination `T` in a 1-dim space.

Hyper-parameters' modifications and algorithm switching are in the class `config` .
